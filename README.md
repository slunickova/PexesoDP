# Memory Game for Dogpoint

This web application was made for a czech dog shelter Dogpoint. It is a modification of a previous Memory game project I created during Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity. It is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There is a couple of fun functionalities built in the game, such as star rating, time and moves counter, restart button or a pop up modal at the end of a game.

This web app will be presented on http://www.dog-point.cz domain as a part of christmass marketing campaign in 2018.

## Instructions
To win the Memory Game, click on two cards at a time to show the picturs. Memorize them and search for pairs. The less moves you make, the more stars you'll obtain. When you finish, play again and try to beat your own time and number of moves. Have fun!

## Live preview
